# godockerize

I was tired to write the same Dockerfile again and again, so I did a
simple tool to generate, a Dockerfile for your Go microservice.

The Dockerfile is based in the golang image, it follows these steps.
* Based in golang:stable
* Use [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) for vendoring the dependencies. (if you are not using godep, It will break).
* Uses the project name and the root directory as a ENTRYPOINT
* Restores the dependencies via 'godep restore'
* Compiles the project
* Exposes the port

The Dockerfile is inspired by this two blog post.
* http://blog.charmes.net/2014/11/release-go-code-and-others-via-docker.html?spref=tw
* https://blog.golang.org/docker

## Install
```
$ go get github.com/dmcd/godockerize

```

## Usage Example
```
# Go to the root directory of your project, for example
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dahernan/gopherscraper


# Run godockerize exposing the port 3001
$ godockerize -expose 3001

Dockerfile generated, you can build the image with:
$ docker build -t gopherscraper .

```

## Build from the scratch image instead of using golang image

**Warning Only tested in Mac, you have to enable cross compilation, check below to see how to do it**

If you use the flag 'scratch', the script is going to:

1. Crosscompile the project for linux
2. Generate a Dockerfile ready to build, from the scratch

```
# Go to the root directory of your project, for example
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dahernan/gopherscraper

# Run godockerize using -scratch
$ godockerize -expose 3001 -scratch

Dockerfile generated, you can build the image with:
$ docker build -t gopherscraper .

```


## How to enable cross compile on Mac to build Linux executable

Follow this steps

```
$ cd /usr/local/go/src

$ sudo GOOS=linux CGO_ENABLED=0 ./make.bash --no-clean

```

You can try it doing for example:

```
$ GOOS=linux CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o gopherscraper

$ file gopherscraper
gopherscraper: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped

```
